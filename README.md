# myLearningExperiments

The intention is to run hands on exercises on some topics of my interests. Right now I am looking to develop some expertise in areas listed below:
1. C Programming
2. Kubernetes
3. eBPF
4. GO Programming
5. C++ Programming

This is my personal collection of all the learning experiments I run and would like to keep them sequential keeping in mind anyone who would like to learn along with me. However there may be some random entries as well which I come across while running  my experiments. Most of these experiments are in order to improve upon my knowledge of system performance.

Experiments with C and C++ Programming would be to dwelve more into system performance on modern hardware where I would try to learn in depth about eBPF and it's application in observability space.

GO Programming epxeriments would dwelve more into Kubernetes space beyond the point of view of an administrator.
